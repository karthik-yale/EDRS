# Repository for: Niche dimensionality drives microbial community structure
This repository hosts the full computational pipeline, comprising Python and R scripts along with Jupyter notebooks, used to perform the data processing, statistical analysis, and visualization for the paper: "Niche dimensionality drives microbial community structure."

Purpose and Scope: The code is made available to ensure the reproducibility and transparency of the analytical methods underpinning the published results. Researchers interested in the specific algorithms and computational steps used in the study will find this a comprehensive guide.

Important Note: Scripts are provided as an archival record of the analysis. They are not designed for direct execution without significant modifications, as they rely on specific file structures, intermediate data not included in this release, and/or environment-specific file paths.
